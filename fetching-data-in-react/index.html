<!-- keeping frontend data up-to-date with the server is a challenging task 
 managing async state becomes increasingly complex with each added feature
 each request has to have a minimum of 3 states to achieve an optimal user
 experience: data, loading, and error 
 
 web APIs are how the apps communicate with their backend over the internet 
  using HTTP
 two common styles for designing web APIs are REST and GraphQL 
 When an app/client needs to access resources from the backend/server, it 
  makes the request through the API and expects a response
  each request and response cycle constitutes an API call
  to initiate API calls either to retrieve information or perform other 
  operations, I will use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE 
  
data fetching can be simple, handling the data upon returning to the client
  can be complicated 
I need to consider:
1. where the data will live
2. how I'll manage the loading state to improve the user experience
3. how I'll manage the error state should anything go wrong
I also need to consider optimizations like caching, request deduplication,
  and preventing race conditions -->
