two APIs to use to load data, loader and userLoaderData
1. create and export a loader function in the root module

3. access and render the data

loader used to specify a function that fetches the required data for the route 
(RR handles when and how to call the loader) 

inside the Root component, useLoaderData is used to retrieve the data fetched 
by the loader */

  React Router will automatically keep the data in sync with my UI */
