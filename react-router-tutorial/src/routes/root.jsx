two APIs to use to load data, loader and userLoaderData
1. create and export a loader function in the root module
2. hook the loader function up to the route
3. access and render the data 

1. EXPORT A LOADER FROM ROOT.JSX 
loader used to specify a function that fetches the required data for the route 
(RR handles when and how to call the loader) 

inside the Root component, useLoaderData is used to retrieve the data fetched 
by the loader */

// G. LOADING DATA
/* V. GET SUBMISSIONS WITH CLIENT SIDE ROUTING
filter the list if there are URLSearchParams

so the code is in the loader and not the action of this route
